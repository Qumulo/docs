## Large Form Factor (LFF) Drive LEDs

To locate the LFF drive LEDs, use the following diagram.

{% capture alt_tag %}Large form factor (LFF) drive LEDs on the {{site.a4200g10p}} node{% endcapture %}

{% include image.html alt=alt_tag file="../../hpe-apollo-4200-gen9/images/lff-drive-leds.png" %}

You can determine the current state of an LFF drive by reviewing the status of the following LEDs:

1. **Fault or UID LED**

   * ðŸŸ  **Amber**
   * ðŸ”µ **Blue**

1. **Online or Activity LED**

   * ðŸŸ¢ **Green**

The following table explains the various combinations of the two LFF LEDs.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Online or Activity LED</th>
    <th>Fault or UID LED</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>On, off, or flashing</td>
    <td>Alternating amber and blue</td>
    <td>One or more of the following conditions exist:
      <ul>
        <li>The drive has failed.</li>
        <li>This system received a predictive failure alert about the drive.</li>
        <li>A management application has selected the drive.</li>
      </ul>

    <td>On, off, or flashing</td>
    <td>Solid blue</td>
    <td>One or more of the following conditions exist:

        <li>The drive is operating normally.</li>
        <li>A management application has selected the drive.</li>

    <td>Don't remove the drive. Removing the drive might terminate the current operation and cause data loss. The drive is part of an array that is undergoing capacity expansion or stripe migration.

    <td>The drive has a critical fault condition and the controller has placed it offline. Replace the drive as soon as possible.</td>

## Small Form Factor (SFF) Drive LEDs
hpe-apollo-4200-gen10
To locate the SFF drive LEDs, use the following diagram.

{% capture alt_tag %}Small form factor (SFF) drive LEDs on the {{site.a4200g10p}} node{% endcapture %}
{% include image.html alt=alt_tag file="sff-gen10-led-guide.png" %}

1. **Locate LED**

   * ðŸ”µ **Solid Blue:** A host application is identifying the drive.
   * ðŸ”µ **Flashing Blue:** The drive carrier firmware is updating or requires an update.

   {% include note.html content="The Locate LED is behind the release lever. When it is illuminated, it is visible." %}

1. **Activity Ring LED**

   * ðŸŸ¢ **Rotating Green:** Drive activity
   * **Off:** No drive activity

1. **Drive Status LED**

   * ðŸŸ¢ **Solid Green:** The drive is a member of one or more logical drives
   * ðŸŸ¢ **Flashing Green:** The drive is rebuilding or performing a RAID migration, strip-size migration, capacity expansion, or logical drive extension or is erasing.
   * ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¢ **Flashing Amber and Green:** The drive is a member of one or more logical drives and predicts drive failure.
   * ðŸŸ  **Flashing Amber:** The drive isn't configured and predicts drive failure.
   * ðŸŸ  **Solid Amber:** The drive has failed.
   * **Off:** A RAID controller hasn't configured the drive.

1. **Do Not Remove LED**

   * âšª **Solid White:** Don't remove the drive. Removing the drive causes one or more of the logical drives to fail.
   * **Off:** Removing the drive doesn't cause a logical drive to fail.

1. **Do Not Remove Button**

   To open the carrier, press the release lever.
