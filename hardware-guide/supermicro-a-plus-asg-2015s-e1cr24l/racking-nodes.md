{{site.sm2015s}} nodes use a rack rail system that comprises an inner rail that you secure to the chassis, an outer rail that you secure to your rack, and the middle rail within the outer rail. For more information, see [Installing the System into a Rack](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=24) in the Supermicro documentation.


## To Insert the Chassis
For information about inserting the {{site.sm2015s}} node chassis into the server rack, see [Installing the Server into the Rack](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=28) in the Supermicro documentation.


## To Remove the Chassis
The {{site.sm2015s}} node chassis rest on the inner rail lip of the left and right rails. Two front latches secure the chassis to the server rack.

1. Disconnect any cables from the chassis. 

1. [Lift one latch on each side of the front of the chassis](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=29).

1. Pull the chassis out from the server rack.

1. (Optional) To remove the outer rails from your server rack completely, see [Removing the Outer Rails from the Rack](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=30) in the Supermicro documentation.
