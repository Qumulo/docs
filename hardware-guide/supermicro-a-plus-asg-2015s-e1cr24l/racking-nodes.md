## To Install the Rack Rail System
The {{site.sm2015s}} rack rail system comprises an inner rail secured to the chassis, an outer rail that secured to the rack, and a middle rail within the outer rail. For more information, see [Installing the System into a Rack](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=24) in the Supermicro documentation.

## To Insert the Chassis
For information about inserting the {{site.sm2015s}} node chassis into the server rack, see [Installing the Server into the Rack](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=28) in the Supermicro documentation.


## To Remove the Chassis
Two front latches secure the {{site.sm2015s}} node chassis to the server rack.

1. Disconnect any cables from the chassis. 

1. [Lift one latch on each side of the front of the chassis](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superstorage/MNL-2628.pdf#page=29).

1. Pull the chassis out from the server rack.
