{% include caution.html content="Read these recommendations carefully. Failure to follow these recommendations can potentially cause damage to your equipment or injure the person who maintains it." %}

* **Operating Ambient Temperature:** When you install nodes in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack or cabinet environment can be greater than the ambient temperature of the room.

  Install your equipment in an environment where the maximum ambient temperature (Tma) does't exceed 40&deg; C (104&deg; F).

* **Sufficient Airflow:** Install your equipment in a way that avoids compromising the amount of airflow required for the equipment's safe operation.

* **Even Mechanical Loading:** Ensure your equipment is level when you mount it.

* **Circuit Load:** Determine the load your equipment can place on your supply circuit and refer to nameplate ratings to determine potential circuit overload scenarios.

* **Reliable Earthing:** Maintain earthing (by connecting to the part of the equipment that doesn't carry current).

  Give particular attention to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (for example, power strips).

* **Redundant Power Supplies (PSU):** When you receive multiple PSUs with your equipment, connect each PSU to a separate circuit.

* **Equipment Under Maintenance:** Ensure that all equipment under maintenance has all of its PSUs disconnected.

* **Battery Replacement:** Use compatible battery types to avoid a potential explosion. Dispose of depleted batteries according to provided instructions.
