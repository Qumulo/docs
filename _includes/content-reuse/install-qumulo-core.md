### Fixable Issues During Installation
If the FVT finds fixable issues, it prompts you to auto-correct any detected issues, depending on your installation scenario. Issues that the FVT can auto-correct include the following:

* BIOS Configuration
* Drive firmware
* NIC mode
* Boot order

1. To attempt auto-correction, select **[1] Run FVT Flash. This will try to fix issues then reboot.**

   If the fixes are successful, the FVT reboots the node automatically.

1. To re-attempt verification, [boot by using the Qumulo Core USB Drive Installer](#step-2-boot-by-using-the-qumulo-core-usb-drive-installer) and then continue the installation.


### Non-Fixable Issues
If the FVT is unable to auto-correct any issues, the message **Not fixable issues were detected.** appears, providing reasons for failure.
