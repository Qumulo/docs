## What is Cloud Native Qumulo on AWS?
{{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} is a self-managed AWS VPC deployment that provisions EC2 instances and uses AWS infrastructure for a Qumulo file system, which allows the disaggregation of persistent storage from compute resources. You can deploy {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} by using [AWS CloudFormation](cloudformation.html) or [Terraform](terraform.html).

{{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} provides the same multi-protocol support, interfaces, and functionality as Qumulo on premises.

## Overview of Deploying {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}}
This section outlines the process of configuring and deploying {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}}.

1. Create persistent storage by using S3 buckets.

1. Deploy cluster compute and cache resources.

1. Perform post-deployment actions.

1. Optimize your deployment.


## {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} Limits
This section lists the {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} limits.

* **24-Node Clusters (CloudFormation):** Although the {{site.cnqLong}} architecture can scale to a high number of nodes, CloudFormation deployments of {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} are limited to a maximum of 24 nodes. For more information, {{site.contactQumuloCare}}.

* **Elastic Block Storage (EBS) gp3 EBS Volume Optimization:** When you use configurations with IOPS or throughput values greater than the defaults of 125 IOPS and 3000 MiB/s, you must ensure that your EBS volumes complete their optimization before you run high performance tasks.

  {% include tip.html content="Because all volumes for a Qumulo cluster are tagged with the same deployment name, you can use the deployment name to filter volumes in the AWS Console." %}

* **Amazon S3 Bucket Warm-Up:** Because {{site.aws.cnqAWSshort}} uses S3 buckets for backing storage, the S3 buckets are subject to throttling prior to partition scale-up.
