The Qumulo Care team monitors the [qumulocare Slack channel](https://qumulocare.slack.com/) during our normal Monday-to-Friday, 24&times;5 standard support hours. If you are currently a Qumulo customer, the fastest way to reach us is by using your dedicated Slack channel.

The following are some tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of making requests through Slack.

* Keep all communications with the Qumulo Care team in your dedicated Slack channel.

  * If you haven't been working with a specific member of the Qumulo Care team, include `@here` in your first message to notify the present Qumulo Care team members of your request.

  * If you've been working with a specific member of the Qumulo Care team, use `@<name>` in your dedicated Slack channel. If that team member is unavailable, another Qumulo Care team member responds to your request.

* Check **Also send to #&lt;channel&gt;** whenever you reply to a message thread.
