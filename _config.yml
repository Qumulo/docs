splitIlo: We strongly recommend separating your iLO access network from your client-facing network.
partReplaceDefine: When you replace a component such as the motherboard or a NIC card in your node, you must ensure that the firmware version and configuration are correct for your new components. To do this, you must perform the part replacement procedure by using the FVT.
partReplaceDcms: Before you replace the motherboard, you must request a new Data Center Management Suite (DCMS) license key from Supermicro and apply it before you run the FVT. (The license key uses the BMC MAC address which changes with the motherboard.) If you don't install a DCMS license on your node, the Field Verification Tool (FVT) fails, preventing you from running the part replacement procedure in the FVT, which normalizes the firmware and BIOS configuration for your new motherboard.

varKerberosDns: Kerberos relies on DNS to identify machines involved in authentication. NFS clients and servers require DNS <code>A</code> records for forward-DNS lookups and <code>PTR</code> records for reverse-DNS lookups.
varNfsConf: In versions of Ubuntu lower than 22.04 (and possibly on other Linux distributions), you can't use the <code>/etc/nfs.conf</code> file to configure <code>gssd</code>. If this is the case for your system, we recommend starting the <code>rpc.gssd</code> service by using the <code>-n</code> flag.

unifyNetDefine: This platform uses a _unified networking configuration_ in which the same NIC handles back-end and front-end traffic. In this configuration, each networking port provides communication with clients and between nodes. You can connect the NIC's ports to the same switch or to different switches.
splitNetJumboFrames: Before you create your Qumulo cluster, if you want to use Jumbo Frames (9,000 MTU), configure your switch to support a higher MTU.
unifyNetJumboFrames: Before you create your Qumulo cluster, if your client environment requires Jumbo Frames (9,000 MTU), configure your switch to support a higher MTU.
use40gbps: You can use 40 Gbps connections with 40 Gbps transceivers.
splitNetLACP: For all connection speeds, the default behavior is that of an LACP with 1,500 MTU for the front-end and 9,000 MTU for the back-end interfaces.

noNIC: For this platform, all models ship without NICs.
seeTechSpecs: Some components vary across node types. For information about node types, see <a href="technical-specifications.html">Technical Specifications</a>.
doNotWarpChassis: To avoid warping the chassis frame, always keep it level while you insert it into the server rack. Never insert the chassis at an angle and don&apos;t apply excessive pressure to it.
twoPeopleOrLift: We strongly recommend using a server lift or that two people perform this task.

varBearerTokenRecommend: As soon as you receive your bearer token, record it in a safe place.
varBearerTokenWarning: If you misplace the bearer token, you can't retrieve it at a later time. You must create a new access token.

consTrans: The consumer processes for email, IFTTT, and ClickSend integrations translate messages into the recipient's native language.

jsonNotTable: The output displays information in a table format. To view the output in JSON format, use the <code>--json</code> flag.

protectingData:
  contactQumuloCare: We strongly recommend contacting the <a href="/contacting-qumulo-care-team.html">Qumulo Care team</a> before proceeding with cluster expansion.
  followAddNodeInstructions: 1. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://care.qumulo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001070307">Add a New Node to an Existing Qumulo Cluster</a> on Qumulo Care.
  checkCapacity: 1. Before you click **Yes** in the **Add &lt;N&gt; nodes to cluster &lt;MyCluster&gt;?** dialog box, check that the projected capacity matches the expected capacity.
  monitorProcess: 1. To monitor this process, click **Cluster > Overview**. On the **Cluster** page, in the protection status section, you can view the rebalance phase status and the estimated time to completion.
  mustHaveCryptoLib: To use this method, you must install the Python cryptography library.
  storeKeysProtectResources: In Qumulo Core 6.1.0 (and higher), you can store multiple ECDSA public keys in the Qumulo file system key store and use these keys to protect filesystem resources.
  supportedKeys: Currently, Qumulo Core supports only 256-bit ECDSA keys in <code>.pem</code> and <code>.der</code> formats. Qumulo Core doesn't support storing ECDSA keys of other lengths and formats.

s3:
  permissions:
    APIorCLI: by using the Qumulo REST API or <code>qq</code> CLI
    directAPI: You can also use the S3 API directly.
    bucketsRead: the <code>PRIVILEGE_S3_BUCKETS_READ</code> privilege
    bucketsWrite: the <code>PRIVILEGE_S3_BUCKETS_WRITE</code> privilege
    commandOutput: The following is example output from the command.
    timesUTC: All times are in the UTC time zone.
    secretAccessKeys: After Qumulo Core initially creates your secret access keys, it never logs or displays them again. If you lose your secret access key, it isn't possible to recover it and you must create a new access key pair.

  separateMachine: Deploy Qumulo Broker on a stand-alone machine (or virtual machine) so that it sits between your Qumulo cluster and Varonis.
  restartRsyslog: To restart the rsyslog service, use the `systemctl restart rsyslog` command.

monitoring:
  cloudBasedMonitoringEnabled: If your configuration is valid, the Web UI shows the status **Enabled &#124; Connected**.

changeNotify:
  useRESTnotSMB: Qumulo provides REST access to the same [change notification system](how-file-system-change-notifications-work.html) that backs SMB2 `CHANGE_NOTIFY`. Because the notification interface and types are easier to work with compared to SMB2, we recommend programming by using REST rather than SMB `CHANGE_NOTIFY`.
