splitIlo: We strongly recommend separating your iLO access network from your client-facing network.
partReplaceDefine: When you replace a component such as the motherboard or a NIC card in your node, you must ensure that the firmware version and configuration are correct for your new components. To do this, you must perform the part replacement procedure by using the FVT.
partReplaceDcms: Before you replace the motherboard, you must request a new Data Center Management Suite (DCMS) license key from Supermicro and apply it before you run the FVT. (The license key uses the BMC MAC address which changes with the motherboard.) If you don't install a DCMS license on your node, the Field Verification Tool (FVT) fails, preventing you from running the part replacement procedure in the FVT, which normalizes the firmware and BIOS configuration for your new motherboard.

varKerberosDns: Kerberos relies on DNS to identify machines involved in authentication. NFS clients and servers require DNS <code>A</code> records for forward-DNS lookups and <code>PTR</code> records for reverse-DNS lookups.
varNfsConf: In versions of Ubuntu lower than 22.04 (and possibly on other Linux distributions), you can't use the <code>/etc/nfs.conf</code> file to configure <code>gssd</code>. If this is the case for your system, we recommend starting the <code>rpc.gssd</code> service by using the <code>-n</code> flag.

unifyNetDefine: This platform uses a _unified networking configuration_ in which the same NIC handles back-end and front-end traffic. In this configuration, each networking port provides communication with clients and between nodes. You can connect the NIC's ports to the same switch or to different switches.
splitNetJumboFrames: Before you create your Qumulo cluster, if you want to use Jumbo Frames (9,000 MTU), configure your switch to support a higher MTU.
unifyNetJumboFrames: Before you create your Qumulo cluster, if your client environment requires Jumbo Frames (9,000 MTU), configure your switch to support a higher MTU.
use40gbps: You can use 40 Gbps connections with 40 Gbps transceivers.
splitNetLACP: For all connection speeds, the default behavior is that of an LACP with 1,500 MTU for the front-end and 9,000 MTU for the back-end interfaces.

seeTechSpecs: Some components vary across node types. For information about node types, see <a href="technical-specifications.html">Technical Specifications</a>.

varBearerTokenRecommend: As soon as you receive your bearer token, record it in a safe place.
varBearerTokenWarning: If you misplace the bearer token, you can't retrieve it at a later time. You must create a new access token.
