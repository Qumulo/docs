  before612AddOnly: Qumulo Core 6.1.0.1 and 6.1.1 support Adaptive Data Protection by letting you reconfigure your cluster's fault tolerance level and storage efficiency only when you add nodes to your cluster.
  before612Description: Depending on your cluster, Qumulo Core shows configuration options that offer better fault tolerance levels, better storage efficiency, or both benefits. To enable Adaptive Data Protection for your cluster, you must
  after612AddReplace: In Qumulo Core 6.1.2 (and higher), you can change your cluster's data protection configuration when you add or replace nodes by using the <code>qq</code> CLI.

determineUUIDs: 1. To determine the UUIDs of the nodes to add to your cluster, use the <code>qq unconfigured_nodes_list</code> command.
noteDownUUIDs: 1. Write down the UUIDs of the nodes that you want to add to the cluster, in the order that you want to add them.
rackNewNodes: 1. Rack and wire your new nodes and then power them on.
cannotReorderNodes: it isn‚Äôt possible to revert this operation or reorder nodes after adding them to a cluster.

hardware:
  ipmiConfig:
    smc: To configure the IPMI port, you must use the IPMI Management Utility installed on the motherboard. For more information, see <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/other/BMC_Users_Guide_X12_H12.pdf">Supermicro BMC User Guide X12</a>.
  ipmiCreds:
    hpe: The default username, password, and DNS name are printed on a serial label pull tab attached to the node.
    quiver: The default IMPI username is <code>ADMIN</code> and the default password is <code>Admin123</code>. 
    smc: The default IPMI username is <code>ADMIN</code> and the default password is printed on a label on the node's motherboard.
    smcNote: As of November 2019, <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/en/support/BMC_Unique_Password">Supermicro no longer uses the default <code>ADMIN</code> password.</a>
    smcMoreInfo1114S: For more information, see <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superserver/1U/MNL-2295.pdf#page=64">IPMI</a> in the Supermicro documentation.

splitIlo: We strongly recommend separating your iLO access network from your client-facing network.
partReplaceDefine: When you replace a component such as the motherboard or a NIC card in your node, you must ensure that the firmware version and configuration are correct for your new components. To do this, you must perform the part replacement procedure by using the FVT.
partReplaceDcms: Before you replace the motherboard, you must request a new Data Center Management Suite (DCMS) license key from Supermicro and apply it before you run the FVT. (The license key uses the BMC MAC address which changes with the motherboard.) If you don't install a DCMS license on your node, the Field Verification Tool (FVT) fails, preventing you from running the part replacement procedure in the FVT, which normalizes the firmware and BIOS configuration for your new motherboard.

varKerberosDns: Kerberos relies on DNS to identify machines involved in authentication. NFS clients and servers require DNS <code>A</code> records for forward-DNS lookups and <code>PTR</code> records for reverse-DNS lookups.
varNfsConf: In versions of Ubuntu lower than 22.04 (and possibly on other Linux distributions), you can't use the <code>/etc/nfs.conf</code> file to configure <code>gssd</code>. If this is the case for your system, we recommend starting the <code>rpc.gssd</code> service by using the <code>-n</code> flag.

unifySplitDepends: Depending on its [technical specifications](technical-specifications.html), your node uses _unified_ or _split networking configuration_.

splitNetDefine: This platform uses a _split networking configuration_ in which different NICs handle back-end and front-end traffic. You can connect the front-end and back-end NICs to the same switch or to different switches.
splitNetLACP: For all connection speeds, the default behavior is that of an LACP with 1,500 MTU for the front-end and 9,000 MTU for the back-end interfaces.
dontMixSingleDualNodes: Never network single-NIC and and dual-NIC nodes within the same cluster.
splitNetDualNICmustUseSplit: Never configure a dual-NIC platform with a unified networking configuration.
splitNetDontConnectSingleNIC: We don't recommend connecting to a single back-end NIC port because the node becomes unavailable if the single connection fails.

unifyNetDefine: This platform uses a _unified networking configuration_ in which the same NIC handles back-end and front-end traffic. In this configuration, each networking port provides communication with clients and between nodes. You can connect the NIC's ports to the same switch or to different switches.
use40gbps: You can use 40 Gbps connections with 40 Gbps transceivers.

jumboFramesPrereq: Before you create your Qumulo cluster, if your client environment requires Jumbo Frames (9,000 MTU), configure your switch to support a higher MTU.
noNIC: For this platform, all models ship without NICs.
seeTechSpecs: Some components vary across node types. For information about node types, see <a href="technical-specifications.html">Technical Specifications</a>.

unusedEthPorts: The two rightmost Ethernet ports on the back of your node are unused.
dualNICfrontBackEnd: For dual-NIC nodes, the left NIC is for the front end and the right NIC is for the back end.

doNotWarpChassis: To avoid warping the chassis frame, always keep it level while you insert it into the server rack. Never insert the chassis at an angle and don&apos;t apply excessive pressure to it.
twoPeopleOrLift: We strongly recommend using a server lift or that two people perform this task.

varBearerTokenRecommend: As soon as you receive your bearer token, record it in a safe place.
varBearerTokenWarning: If you misplace the bearer token, you can't retrieve it at a later time. You must create a new access token.

  useRESTnotSMB: Qumulo provides REST access to the same [change notification system](how-file-system-change-notifications-work.html) that backs SMB2 `CHANGE_NOTIFY`. Because the notification interface and types are easier to work with compared to SMB2, we recommend programming by using REST rather than SMB `CHANGE_NOTIFY`.
