# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for helping make Qumulo documentation better! Your feedback means a lot to us. ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Important:** Currently, we don't publish Qumulo documentation directly to the public GitHub repo. After we complete the automated build process, we mirror the `mainline` branch of the repository from the internal repo to the public repo and then publish the content to GitHub Pages. For this reason, the changes that you submit don't appear immediately.

## What Contributions We Look For
We always appeciate it when users submit issues for:

* Inaccurate or incomplete information
* Ideas for improving the usability (UX) of the Documentation Portal
* Broken links
* Typos, spelling, or grammar errors
* Requests for translation
* Compliments üòä

**Note:** Qumulo's technical writers use an in-house style guide designed to maximize the UX of technical documentation. We appreciate all comments, but if your issue is primarily about writing style, we might not accept it.

## How to Contribute
To contribute, open an issue.

1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/Qumulo/docs/issues) tab and then click **New issue**.

1. In the New issue form, give your issue a meaningful title (for example, "IPMI authentication is unclear") and then enter a description. Include the following information:
