{% include note.html content="From Qumulo Core 4.3.4, Shift-From estimates the work that a copy job performs." %}

## Prerequisites
* A Qumulo cluster with:

  * Qumulo Core 4.2.3 (or higher)

  * HTTPS connectivity to `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` though one of the following means:

    * Public Internet

    * [VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html)

    * [AWS Direct Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect.html)
    
    For more information, see [AWS IP address ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) in the AWS General Reference.

* Membership in a Qumulo role with the following privileges:

  * `PRIVILEGE_REPLICATION_OBJECT_WRITE`: This privilege is required to create a Shift relationship.

  * `PRIVILEGE_REPLICATION_OBJECT_READ`: This privilege is required to view the status of a Shift relationship.

  {{site.data.alerts.note}}
  <ul>
    <li>For any changes to take effect, user accounts with newly assigned roles must log out and log back in (or their sessions must time out).</li>
    <li>Use special care when granting privileges to roles and users because certain privileges (such as replication-write privileges) can use system privileges to overwrite or move data to a location where a user has greater permissions. This can give a user access to all directories and files in a cluster regardless of any specific file and directory settings.</li>
  </ul>
  {{site.data.alerts.end}}

* An existing bucket with contents in Amazon S3

* AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) with the following permissions:

  * `s3:GetObject`

  * `s3:ListBucket`

  For more information, see [Understanding and getting your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the AWS General Reference
  
### Example IAM Policy
In the following example, the IAM policy gives permission to read from and write to the `my-folder` folder in the `my-bucket`. This policy can give users the minimal set of permissions required to run Shift-From jobs. (Shift-To jobs require a less-restrictive policy. For more information and an example, see [Using Qumulo Shift-To for Amazon S3 to Copy Objects](/shift-to-s3.md).)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-folder/*"
    }
  ]
}
```


## How Shift-From Relationships Work
Qumulo Core performs the following steps when it creates a Shift-From relationship.

1. Verifies that the directory exists on the Qumulo cluster and that the specified S3 bucket exists, is accessible by using the specified credentials, and contains downloadable objects.

1. Creates the Shift-From relationship.

1. Starts a job by using one of the nodes in the Qumulo cluster.

   {% include note.html content="If you perform multiple Shift operations, Qumulo Core uses multiple nodes." %}


1. Lists the contents of the S3 folder and downloads the objects to the specified directory on your Qumulo cluster.

1. Forms the full path of the file on the Qumulo custer by appending the path of the object (relative to the S3 folder) to the directory path on the Qumulo cluster.

   For example, the following object is downloaded to `/my-dir/my-project/file.text`, where `my-folder` is the specified S3 folder and `my-dir` is the directory on your Qumulo cluster.

   ```
   https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-folder/my-project/file.txt
   ```

   {% include note.html content="This process doesn't encode or transform your data in any way. Shift-From attempts only to map every S3 object in the specified folder to a file on your Qumulo cluster." %}

1. Avoids redownloading an unchanged object in a subsequent job by tracking the information about an object and its replicated object.

   {% include note.html content="If you rename or move an object or local file between jobs, or if there are any metadata changes in S3 or Qumulo, the object is replicated again." %}

### Storing and Reusing Relationships
The Shift-From relationship remains on the Qumulo cluster. You can monitor the completion status of a job, start new jobs for a relationship after the initial job finishes, and delete the relationship (when you no longer need the S3-folder-Qumulo-directory pair). To avoid redownloading objects that a previous copy job downloaded, relationships take up approximately 100 bytes for each object. To free this storage, you can delete relationships that you no longer need.

If you repeatedly download from the same S3 folder, you can speed up the download process (and skip already downloaded files) by using the same relationship.

A new relationship for subsequent downloads doesn't share any tracking information with previous relationships associated with a directory and might recopy data that is already downloaded.


## Using the Qumulo Web UI to Copy Files and Manage Relationships
This section describes how to use the Qumulo Web UI 4.2.5 (and higher) to copy files from Amazon S3 to a Qumulo cluster, review Shift relationship details, stop a running copy job, repeat a completed copy job, and delete a relationship.

### To Copy Files from Amazon S3
1. Log in to Qumulo Core.

1. Click **Cluster > Copy to/from S3**.

1. On the **Copy to/from S3** page, click **Create Copy**.

1. On the **Create Copy to/from S3** page, click **Local â‡¦ Remote** and then enter the following:

   1. The **Directory Path** on your cluster (`/` by default)

   1. The S3 **Bucket Name**

   1. The **Folder** in your S3 bucket

   1. The **Region** for your S3 bucket

   1. Your AWS **Region** (`/` by default)

   1. Your AWS **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

1. (Optional) For additional configuration, click **Advanced S3 Server Settings**.

1. Click **Create Copy**.

1. In the **Create Copy from S3?** dialog box, review the Shift relationship and then click **Yes, Create**.

   The copy job begins and Qumulo Core estimates the work to be performed. When the estimation is complete, the Web UI displays a progress bar with a percentage for a relationship on the **Replication Relationships** page. The page also displays the estimated total work, the remaining bytes and files, and the estimated time to completion for a running copy job.

   {% include note.html content="For work estimates, Shift-From jobs calculate the total number of files and bytes in a job's bucket prefix. This requires the job to use the [`ListObjectV2` S3 action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html) once for every 5,000 objects (or 200 times for every 1 million objects)." %}

{% include content-reuse/shift-view-config-details-stop-job-repeat-job-delete-relationship.md %}


## Using the Qumulo CLI to Copy Files and Manage Relationships
This section describes how to use the Qumulo CLI to copy files from Amazon S3 to a Qumulo cluster, review Shift relationship details, stop a running copy job, repeat a completed copy job, and delete a relationship.

### Copying Files from Amazon S3
To copy files, use the `replication_create_object_relationship` command and specify the following:
* Local directory path on Qumulo cluster
* Copy direction (copy-from)
* S3 object folder
* S3 bucket
* AWS region
* AWS access key ID
* AWS secret access key

The following example shows how to create a relationship between the directory `/my-dir/` on a Qumulo cluster and the S3 bucket `my-bucket` and folder `/my-folder/` in the `us-west-2` AWS region. The secret access key is associated with the access key ID.

```bash
qq replication_create_object_relationship \
  --local-directory-path /my-dir/ \
  --direction COPY_FROM_OBJECT \
  --object-folder /my-folder/ \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
  --secret-access-key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

The CLI returns the details of the relationship in JSON format, for example:

```json
{
  "access_key_id": "ABC",
  "bucket": "my-bucket",
  "object_store_address": "s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
  "id": "1c23b4ed-5c67-8f90-1e23-a4f5f6ceff78",
  "object_folder": "my-folder/",
  "port": 443,
  "ca_certificate": null,
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "local_directory_id": "3",
  "direction": "COPY_FROM_OBJECT",
}
```

{% include content-reuse/shift-view-config-details-status-shift-relationship.md %}

  ```json

    {
      "direction": "COPY_FROM_OBJECT",
      "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",

        }
      },
      "last_job": null
    }
  ]
  ```
{% include content-reuse/shift-view-status-description.md %}

  Shift-From performs a single task that estimates the amount of content to copy by listing all files and summing up their contents. Until this task is complete, the `percent_complete` field is set to `"None"` and the `estimated_end_time` field is set to `""`. To list the bucket prefix content in sets of 5,000 objects, this task uses the [`ListObjectV2` S3 action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html).

## Troubleshooting Copy Job Issues
Any fatal errors that occur during a copy job cause the job to fail, leaving a partially copied set of files in the directory on your Qumulo cluster.  However, to let you review the Shift relationship status any failure messages, the Shift relationship continues to exist. You can start a new job to complete the copying of objects from the S3 bucket&#8212;any successfully transferred files from the previous job aren't retransferred to your Qumulo cluster.

Whenever Qumulo Core doesn't complete an operation successfully and returns an error from the API or CLI, the `error` field within the `last_job` field (that the `replication_list_object_relationship_statuses` command returns) contains a detailed failure message. For more troubleshooting details, see `qumulo-replication.log` on your Qumulo cluster.


## Best Practices
We recommend the following best practices for working with Qumulo Shift-From for Amazon S3.
* **Inheritable Permissions:** Because the system user creates the files that Shift-From for S3 copies, the system owns these files. By default, everyone is granted read permissions and administrators always have full access to the files.

  {% include note.html content="To ensure that the copied files and subdirectories have the correct permissions, you must assign the necessary inheritable permissions to the root directory of the relationship _before_ you create a Shift-From S3 relationship. To edit directory permissions, you can use the Windows Security Dialog or the `qq fs_modify_acl` command. For more information, see [Qumulo File Permissions Overview](https://care.qumulo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008211868) on Qumulo Care." %}

* **VPC Endpoints:** For best performance when using a Qumulo cluster in AWS, configure a [VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) to S3. For on-premises Qumulo clusters, we recommend [AWS Direct Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect.html) or another high-bandwidth, low-latency connection to S3.
* **Repeated Synchronization:** If you need to repeatedly synchronize an S3 folder with a Qumulo directory, we recommend reusing the same relationship. This lets you avoid repeated downloading of unchanged objects that already exist locally.
* **Completed Jobs:** If you don't plan to use a Shift relationship to download updates from S3, delete the relationship to free up any storage associated with it.
* **Concurrent Replication Relationships:** To increase parallelism, especially across distinct datasets, use concurrent replication relationships from S3. To avoid having a large number of concurrent operations impact client I/O to the Qumulo cluster, limit the number of concurrent replication relationships. While there is no hard limit, we don't recommend creating more than 100 concurrent replication relationships on a cluster (including both Shift and Qumulo local replication relationships).


## Restrictions
* **S3-Compatible Object Stores:** S3-compatible object stores aren't supported. Currently, Qumulo Shift-From supports replication only from Amazon S3.
* **HTTP:** HTTP isn't supported. All Qumulo connections are encrypted by using HTTPS and verify the S3 server's SSL certificate.
* **Anonymous Access:** Anonymous access isn't supported. You must use valid AWS credentials.
* **Replication without Throttling:** Replication provides no throttling and might use all available bandwidth. If necessary, use Quality of Service rules on your network.
* **Amazon S3 Standard Storage Class:** Qumulo Shift-From supports downloading only objects stored in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. You can't download objects stored in the Amazon S3 Glacier or Deep Archive storage classes and any buckets that contain such objects cause a copy job to fail.
* **Disallowed Amazon S3 Paths in Qumulo Clusters:** Certain allowed Amazon S3 paths can't be copied to Qumulo clusters and cause a copy job to fail. Disallowed paths contain:
  * A trailing slash (`/`) character (with non-zero object content length)
  * Consecutive slash (`/`) characters
  * Single and double period (`.`, `..`) characters
  * The path component `.snapshot`
* **Disallowed Conflicting Types:** When content in an S3 bucket or Qumulo directory changes over time, a conflict related to type mismatches might arise, the Shift-from job fails, and an error message gives details about the conflict. For example, a conflict might occur when a remote object maps to a local file system directory entry which:
  * Is a regular file with two or more links
  * Isn't a regular file (for example, a directory or a special file)
* **Disallowed Amazon S3 Path Configurations:** Because of conflicting type requirements, Qumulo Core can't recreate certain allowed Amazon S3 path configurations on Qumulo clusters. For example, if an S3 bucket contains objects `a/b/c` and `a/b`, then path `a/b` must be both a file and directory on a Qumulo cluster. Because this isn't possible, this configuration causes a copy job to fail.
* **Directories in Multiple Relationships:** A directory on a Qumulo cluster for one Shift relationship can't overlap with a directory used for another Shift relationship, or with a remote directory for a Qumulo-to-Qumulo replication relationship. This causes the relationship creation to fail.
* **Changes to S3 Folder During Copy Job:** Currently, Shift-From assumes that the S3 folder remains unchanged throughout the copy job. Any changes (deleting, archiving, or modifying an object) during the copy job might cause a copy job to fail.
* **Read-Only Local Directory:** When the Shift-From copy job begins, the local directory on the Qumulo cluster becomes read-only. While no external clients can modify anything in the directory or its subdirectories, all content remains readable. When the copy job is complete, the directory reverts to its previous permissions.
* **Partially Downloaded Files:** If a copy job is interrupted or encounters a fatal error (that can't be resolved by retrying the operation), Qumulo Core attempts to delete partially downloaded files. Because this is a best-effort process, certain interruptions can prevent the cleanup of partially downloaded files.
