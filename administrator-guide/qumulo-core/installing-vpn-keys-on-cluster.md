This section explains how to install VPN keys on your Qumulo cluster over a network. You can install the VPN keys by using the `qq` CLI from a machine on the same network as your cluster or from one of your nodes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have done the following.

* Obtain a `.zip` file with VPN keys from Qumulo Care

* Whitelist the following domains in your firewall rules:

  * `ep.qumulo.com`

  * `missionq.qumulo.com`

  * `monitor.qumulo.com`

* Permit outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

{% include note.html content="If your firewall performs stateful packet inspection (also known as _SPI_ or _deep-packet inspection_), you must allow OpenVPN (SSL VPN) explicitly, rather than only open port 443." %}


## To Install VPN Keys from a Networked Machine
1. Copy the `.zip` file from Qumulo Care to a computer on the same network as your cluster, and decompress the file.

1. Install the `qq` CLI on the same computer. For more information, see [QQ CLI: Get Started](https://care.qumulo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008165008) on Qumulo Care.

## To Install VPN Keys from a Node
{% include note.html content="On macOS and Linux, you can use the `scp` and `ssh` tools. On Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows 10 (build 1809 and higher), we recommend [installing OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)." %}

1. Copy the `.zip` file from Qumulo Care to a computer on the same network as your cluster, and decompress the file.

1. To copy the VPN key files to one of your nodes, use the `scp` command. For example:

   ```bash
   scp /my-path/* admin@203.0.113.1:~/
   ```

1. To connect to the node to which you copied the VPN key files, use the `ssh` command. For example:

   ```bash
   ssh admin@203.0.113.1
   ```

   The `qq` CLI is available to the admin user. For example:

   ```bash
   qq version
   ```

1. To install the VPN keys on your cluster, use the below command and specify the location of the key. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo qq install_vpn_keys /my/path/*
   ```
1. To verify that the VPN keys installed correctly, use the get_vpn_keys command. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo qq get_vpn_keys
   ```


## To Register Cluster with Cloud-Based Monitoring

1. To retrieve your cluster ID, use the `node_state_get` command.

   ```bash
   qq --host 203.0.113.1 node_state_get
   ```

1. Send the output of the command to Qumulo Care.

1. Use the Web UI to enable Qumulo Care Remote Support.

1. Notify Qumulo Care when this process is complete.

   Qumulo Care verifies your VPN functionality and then adds your cluster to Cloud-Based Monitoring.
