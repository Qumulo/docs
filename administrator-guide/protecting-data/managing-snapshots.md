The **Snapshots** page lets you work with a large numbers of saved snapshots without having to make API queries. This makes it possible to delegate snapshot management operations to a wide range of users.

## To View Your Snapshots
The **Snapshots** page lets you navigate a large number of snapshots.

{{page.varLogin}}

{{page.varSaved}}

1. If you have more than 50 snapshots, click {% include inline_image.html alt="Pagination controls" file="managing-snapshots-pagination.png" max-width="40" %} to navigate the snapshot pages.

   You can also use the controls at the bottom of the table to navigate to a specific page or change the number of rows for each page.

## To Find a Specific Snapshot

The table on the **Snapshots** page has a filtering mode that lets you search for a specific snapshot by name, creation time, or any other column.

{{page.varLogin}}

{{page.varSaved}}

1. At the top of the table, click {% include inline_image.html alt="Filters off" file="managing-snapshots-filter-off.png" max-width="75"%}.

   The **Search...** field appears.

1. Enter a search query.

   The table rows filter to match your query as you type.

1. To toggle filtering off, click {% include inline_image.html alt="Filters on" file="managing-snapshots-filter-on.png" max-width="75"%}.

## To Delete a Single Snapshot

{{page.varLogin}}

{{page.varSaved}}

1. On the right-most side of a snapshot's row, click {% include inline_image.html alt="Delete icon" file="managing-snapshots-delete.png" max-width="25" %}.

## To Delete Multiple Snapshots

{{page.varLogin}}

{{page.varSaved}}

1. On the left-most side of the table, click the checkbox for every snapshot you want to delete.

   When you select more than one row, the **Delete** button appears.

1. When you finish selecting snapshots, click **Delete**.

{% include note.html content="All selection and deletion controls modify only the current page. You can't delete a snapshot accidentally if it isn't listed on the current page (because it is on a different page or is filtered out)." %}
