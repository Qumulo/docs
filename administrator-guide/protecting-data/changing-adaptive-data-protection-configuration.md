## Reconfiguring Your Cluster's Adaptive Data Protection
In Qumulo Core 5.3.4 (and higher), as you expand your cluster, you might need to reconfigure its data protection to change the disk- or node-fault-tolerance level (to guarantee the same Mean Time to Data Loss threshold) and, when possible, to take advantage of higher storage efficiency.

## Cluster Expansion Scenarios
The following sections describe two cluster expansion scenarios. Identify the scenario that applies to your cluster expansion plan.

### Adding Nodes without Adaptive Data Protection Reconfiguration

When the restriper completes the provisioning of additional usable capacity, the **Data Protected** section shows the same disk-fault-tolerance and node-fault-tolerance levels as before the node-add operation.

### Adding Nodes with Adaptive Data Protection Reconfiguration
1. Contact Qumulo Care for help with one of the following strategies.
   
   * Reduce the impact of data protection reconfiguration on your primary workload by decreasing background resource consumption.

   * Speed up the data protection reconfiguration process during off-peak time periods (with impact on your primary workload) by increasing background resource consumption.

When Qumulo Core completes the reconfiguration of data protection, the **Data Protected** section shows the changed disk-fault-tolerance and node-fault-tolerance levels and, during the next rebalancing phase, the restriper begins to provision additional usable capacity.
